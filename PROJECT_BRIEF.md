# Frame Extractor PWA
## Project Brief

### Overview
A minimalist Progressive Web App designed for content creators to quickly extract individual frames from videos on their mobile device. Single-purpose tool optimized for speed, simplicity, and mobile user experience.

**Target User**: Content creators working with AI video generation tools who need to extract frames for use as input in their creative workflows.

**Core Value**: Fast, intuitive frame extraction with zero learning curve.

## Technical Specifications

### Platform & Technology
- **Type**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Platform**: Mobile web browsers (iOS Safari primary, Android Chrome secondary)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Video Processing**: HTML5 Video API + Canvas API
- **Installation**: Installable to home screen, offline-capable

### Display Requirements
- **Orientation**: Portrait primary (landscape supported)
- **Resolution**: Responsive, mobile-first (375px - 428px width)
- **Theme**: Dark mode only (#1a1a1a background)
- **Design Style**: Minimalist, clean, inspired by fitness tracking apps

### Workflow
1. Upload video from camera roll
2. Scrub through video timeline
3. Extract current frame
4. Save as PNG to camera roll
5. Repeat or start new video

---

## Core Features

### 1. Video Upload
- Source: Device camera roll only
- Formats: MP4, MOV, all standard mobile video formats
- Method: Native file picker
- Size limit: Up to 500MB

### 2. Video Playback
- Custom minimal player with Marline aesthetic
- SVG play/pause icons with smooth animations
- **Automatic FPS detection** using requestVideoFrameCallback API
- **MM:SS:FF timecode display** (like Adobe Premiere)
- Frame-by-frame timeline scrubber with **dynamic step size** based on detected FPS
- Real-time video preview while scrubbing
- Visual tick marks for frame indication
- Frame counter display while scrubbing
- Maintains video aspect ratio
- Mobile-optimized (55vh on mobile, 50vh on desktop)
- "TAP PLAY TO BEGIN" overlay for intuitive first interaction
- iOS Safari compatibility (inline playback, scrubbing while paused)

### 3. Frame Extraction
- **Three extraction buttons**: FIRST | FRAME | LAST
- **FIRST button**: Instantly extracts first frame of video
- **LAST button**: Instantly extracts last frame of video
- **FRAME button**: Extracts current frame
- Extract as PNG at native video resolution (no scaling)
- Sequential naming: frame_001.png, frame_002.png, etc.
- Numbering resets each session
- Direct download to device
- Extraction time: < 2 seconds

### 4. User Flow
- Success message after save: "Saved to camera roll"
- Two post-extraction options:
  - "Extract Another" (stay on current video)
  - "Start New Video" (return to upload)

## Technical Notes

### Frame Extraction Method
```javascript
// 1. Load video in <video> element
// 2. Create hidden <canvas> element
// 3. Draw current video frame to canvas with drawImage()
// 4. Convert canvas to PNG using toBlob()
// 5. Trigger download with <a download> attribute
```
